# Code Review

This repo contains all information collected after a Code Review session was performed on a large size University course. 

[Code Review folder](Code%20Reviews) contains the code review documents reported by students. All names and links to their projects have been removed to protect students' privacy (be aware that language typos and inconsistencies might be present). The list below links to Code Review documents that are very well structured. These docs can be used as examples for future Code Review sessions:

1. [review 1](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview8.pdf)
2. [review 2](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview3.pdf)
3. [review 3](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview9.pdf)
4. [review 4](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview2.pdf)
5. [review 5](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview6.pdf)
6. [review 6](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview10.pdf)
7. [review 7](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview1.pdf)
8. [review 8](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview18.pdf)
9. [review 9](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview19.pdf)
10. [review 10](Code%20Reviews/CodeReview14.pdf)

We also conducted an exit survey for all participants and another one for only reviewers. All responses can be found [here](QuestionnaireResponses).

You can use these [Slides](CodeReviewSlides.pdf) and this [template](Template%20code%20review.docx) in your course.
